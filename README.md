# LA-for-DS-Tutorial

This repo presents a turorial on linear algebra for data science. We will cover the following topics:

1. Linear Algebra functions in Python
2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
3. Linear Regression
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. Deep Neural Networks


# Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 for this tutorial. Preferred distribution is Anaconda, which can be installed from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). You will also need the following libraries (which are included in Anaconda):

1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scikit-learn
4. tensorflow


# Installation

If you're not using Anaconda, you might want to install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You might also want to install the above libraries using `pip` on the Terminal/Command Prompt as follows:

1. numpy: `pip install numpy`
2. matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
3. scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
4. tensorflow: `pip install tensorflow`
